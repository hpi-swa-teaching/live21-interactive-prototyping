# live21-interactive-prototyping

Programming tangible User Interfaces can be difficult and time consuming. This is a novel tool, written in Sandblocks, Squeak/Smalltalk, that enables users to easily and quickly do rapid prototyping for interactive user interfaces.
It uses a component-like structure inspired by ReactJS, but in a more simple and visual way. The user works with reusable components and visually connects behavior and state with UI elements.

How to test it:
- Import the source code in your local Smalltalk image (make sure it supports [Sandblocks](https://github.com/tom95/sandblocks)).
- Open a workspace and type `SBEditor open`. Mark the text and press Ctrl + D (to execute it).
- Open another workspace with Ctrl + T and type `sbEditor openMoprhInView: LPComponent new`. Press Ctrl + D again.
- Open the palette (top left button in the SBEditor) and your are all set up! Happy prototyping!
